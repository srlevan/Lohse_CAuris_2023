Files and scripts related to the R based approach for calling variant sequences. There are four files contained within this zip file. Name.txt contains the names and ortholog mapping for genes between the two C. auris reference sequences as well as C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. Sample info.txt contains the basic information for the samples being analyzed. mpileup.sh is a shell script that goes through calling variants using sam files as an input and giving the output as sorted vcf files. MattAuris.R is a R script that organizes the sequencing data using sampleinfo.txt, the gff files for the two reference genomes, and the sorted vcf files; the resulting output is given as a tsv file.
